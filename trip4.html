    <p>Ladakh /ləˈdɑːk/[7] is a region administered by India as a union territory, and constitutes a part of the larger Kashmir region, which has been the subject of dispute between India, Pakistan, and China since 1947.[8][9] Ladakh is bordered by the Tibet
        Autonomous Region to the east, the Indian state of Himachal Pradesh to the south, both the Indian-administered union territory of Jammu and Kashmir and the Pakistan-administered Gilgit-Baltistan to the west, and the southwest corner of Xinjiang
        across the Karakoram Pass in the far north. It extends from the Siachen Glacier in the Karakoram range to the north to the main Great Himalayas to the south.[10][11] The eastern end, consisting of the uninhabited Aksai Chin plains, is claimed
        by the Indian Government as part of Ladakh, and has been under Chinese control since 1962.[12][13] In the past Ladakh gained importance from its strategic location at the crossroads of important trade routes,[14] but as the Chinese authorities
        closed the borders between Tibet Autonomous Region and Ladakh in the 1960s, international trade dwindled. Since 1974, the Government of India has successfully encouraged tourism in Ladakh. As Ladakh is strategically important, the Indian military
        maintains a strong presence in the region. The largest town in Ladakh is Leh, followed by Kargil, each of which headquarters a district.[15] The Leh district contains the Indus, Shyok and Nubra river valleys. The Kargil district contains the Suru,
        Dras and Zanskar river valleys. The main populated regions are the river valleys, but the mountain slopes also support the pastoral Changpa nomads. The main religious groups in the region are Muslims (mainly Shia) (46%), Buddhists (mainly Tibetan
        Buddhists) (40%), Hindus (12%) and others (2%).[16][17] Ladakh is one of the most sparsely populated regions in India. Its culture and history are closely related to that of Tibet</p>
